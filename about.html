          <p>Ama is my 20 years old sister and a great inspiration to me personally. 
            <br> inspires me most about Ama is her ability to genuinely empathize with others and her relentless nature of always wanting to help other people however she can. <br>
            Ama is currently in her junior year of college at Sam Houston University majoring in psychology and a minor in biology. <br>
            Ama was born in Nigeria and migrated with her family to the United States when she was two years old. <br>
            Ama has lived in four different states: Iowa, Chicago Illinois, Bronx New York, and Houston Texas. <br>
            Between 8th grade and 10th grade, Ama went to high school in Nigeria, which she considers to be a period of cultural exposure and adventure during that point of her life. <br>
            Ama has several hobbies, some of her favorites are, crocheting, Interior designing, taking trips with her friends. Ama is very social and outgoing and enjoys helping other people however she can. <br>
            Her dream is to become a clinical psychologist, where she feels she will be able to help others navigate through difficulties in life.
